Currently, only the Vector class exists.

To try it out, install as described in the README. Then just import the esp.standard module in python:

For example, to print a 3 element zero vector:
$python 
>>> import esp.standard as esp
>>> vec = esp.Vector( 0, 3 ) 
>>> print vec

For further documentation, try help( esp.standard ) from within python.
